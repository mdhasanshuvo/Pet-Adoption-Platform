## üìù Project Description

Peddy is a user-friendly pet adoption platform that allows users to explore various categories of pets, view details, and adopt their perfect companion. With features like sorting by price, liking pets, and viewing detailed information, the platform ensures a smooth and enjoyable pet adoption process.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Dynamic Pet Categories**: Fetch and display pets by categories like dogs, cats, rabbits, and birds.
- **Sort by Price**: Easily sort pets in descending order by price.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ES6 Features Used

- **Arrow Functions**: Streamlined syntax for writing functions, making the code more concise and readable, especially when handling callbacks in asynchronous operations (e.g., within `.then()` methods).
  
- **Template Literals**: Enhanced string construction using backticks to seamlessly embed variables and expressions into HTML structures, improving readability and reducing complexity (e.g., `${value.category}` for dynamic content generation).
  
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Simplified the extraction of specific properties from complex objects, allowing for more efficient and cleaner handling of API responses (e.g., extracting `categories` from API data).
  
- **Default Parameters**: Ensured robustness by providing fallback values for undefined data, improving user experience by avoiding empty or broken display fields (e.g., `${value?.price ?? "Not available"}`).
  
- **Promises with then/catch**: Enabled elegant handling of asynchronous API requests using `fetch()`, allowing the code to process data with `.then()` for success and `.catch()` for error management, ensuring smooth and reliable interactions with external services.
